        description: "Dr. Lu is a physicist whom research consists of : Development of low-cost and rapid methods for DNA sequencing, in addition to its obvious medical application, can potentially enable many future breakthroughs in biological and biomedical research. The first and second generations of sequencing methods are based on biochemical techniques; while the developing third generation methods are focusing on the physical properties: electronic properties of DNA nucleotides inside a nanogap between two nanoelectrodes. We propose to study quantum transport properties of DNA nucleotides inside a nanogap and validate the possibility in sequencing DNA. Our previous studies show the existence of environmental noise and structural noise in measuring transverse tunneling current and propose to include capacitance measurement. Further studies on the combination of dc and ac properties of DNA nucleotides inside a nanogap are necessary and will be carried out for the possibility in sequencing DNA.",
