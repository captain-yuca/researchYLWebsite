        researchName: 'Ultra Rapid Quenching Apparatus',
        description: 'Ultra Rapid Quenching Apparatus (URQA) is supported by NSF-MRI program. (NSF Award: DMR 1531755). The URQA consists of a crucible-free levitation melting and splat quenching system, which makes it well suited for melting reactive materials bearing high melting points. The synthesis of amorphous, microcrystalline and metastable phases are the result of high cooling rates of more than 106 K·s-1. A high-velocity two-piston system is driven by solenoids; when activated the fronting flat surface splat-quenched the falling liquid sample, forcing the exposed large surface area to cool and solidify at high cooling rates. Therefore, synchronizing dropping melt and pistons require strict control, which is achieved by means of a laser light barrier. Easily exchangeable copper pistons or other high conductivity metals are used. The compact high-vacuum chamber for operation is kept under ultra-clean operating conditions; alternative inert gas backfilling operating is available. The URQA strongly supports the non-equilibrium preparation of clathrates.',

        description: 'The free-cryogen physical property measurement system (PPMS) which is supported by NSF-MRI program (NSF Award: DMR 0821284). This system includes capabilities for measuring electrical conductivity, magnetoresistance, Hall effect, DC and AC susceptibility, and heat capacity. The cryogen-free cryocooler-based system allows measurements from 1.6 to 325 K. The 9 Tesla field will be a unique feature of this system. These are physical property measurements and materials characterizations which are relevant to most fields in physics, and materials science and engineering. This cryogen-free system will incur low operating costs in low temperature measurements.',

        researchName: 'Superconductivity in Al-substituted Ba8Si46 clathrates',
        description: 'There is a great deal of interest vested in the superconductivity of Si clathrate compounds with sp3 network, in which the structure is dominated by strong covalent bonds among silicon atoms, rather than the metallic bonding that is more typical of traditional superconductors. A jointexperimental and theoretical investigation of superconductivity in Al-substituted type-I silicon clathrates is reported. Samples of the general formula Ba8Si46xAlx, with different values of x were prepared. With an increase in the Al composition, the superconducting transition temperature TC was observed to decrease systematically. The resistivity measurement revealed that Ba8Si42Al4 is superconductive with transition temperature at TC¼5.5 K. The magnetic measurements showed that the bulk superconducting Ba8Si42Al4 is a type II superconductor. For x¼6 sample Ba8Si40Al6, the superconducting transition was observed down to TC¼4.7K which pointed to a strong suppression of superconductivity with increasing Al content as compared with TC¼8K for Ba8Si46. Suppression of superconductivity can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level, caused by reduced integrity of the sp3 hybridized networks as well as the lowering of carrier concentration. These results corroborated by first-principles calculations showed that Al substitution results in a large decrease of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, which also explains the decreased superconducting critical temperature within the BCS framework. The work provided a comprehensive understanding of the doping effect on superconductivity of clathrates. VC 2013 AIP Publishing LLC. To keep reading press "more information", thank you.',

        researchName: 'The effect of Al-substitution on superconducting type-I clathrate Ba8Si46',
        description: 'A series of samples with the chemical formula Ba8Si46xAlx (x = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8) were prepared by arc melting, ball milling and washing with diluted HCl. The lattice parameter of Ba8Si46xAlx increases linearly with the increase of nominal Al content x. The composition analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shown that the actual Al contents in clathrates are lager than the nominal compositions because the dilute Al-contained impurity phases were washed out. The experimental results show that the minimum incorporation of Al into clathrate structure is expected to be about 3 at ambient pressure, which is in agreement with a first-principle simulation. The Al substitution for Si results in the decrease of superconducting transition temperature TC, which can be explained on the BCS theoretical frame. The electron density of state at Fermi level N(EF) decreases with the increment of x except for an abnormal increase for the sample x = 6. Such sample has a higher spatial symmetry of the structure in which all the six Si atoms at 6c sites were substituted by Al atoms. Its higher N(EF) causes to a higher TC. In addition, we calculated the phonon-dispersion relations and vibrational density of states for Al-doped silicon clathrates. The high frequency acoustic branch has a red shift from 430 cm1 to 420 cm1 with the doping of Al. The decreased frequency of bond-stretching vibration modes is another reason for the suppression of TC induced by Al substitution. To keep reading press "more information", thank you.',

        researchName: 'Effect of Eu substitution on superconductivity in Ba82xEuxAl6Si40 clathrates',
        description: 'The silicon clathrate superconductor is uncommon as its structure is dominated by strong Si-Si covalent bonds, rather than the metallic bond, that are more typical of traditional superconductors. To understand the influence of large magnetic moment of Eu on superconductivity for type-I clathrates, a series of samples with the chemical formula Ba8xEuxAl6Si40 (x¼0, 0.5, 1, and 2) were synthesised in which Eu occupied Ba sites in cage center. With the increase of Eu content, the cubic lattice parameter decreases monotonically signifying continuous shrinkage of the constituting (Ba/Eu)@Si20 and (Ba/Eu)@Si24 cages. The temperature dependence of magnetization at low temperature revealed that Ba8Al6Si40 is superconductive with transition temperature at TC¼5.6 K. The substitution of Eu for Ba results in a strong superconductivity suppression; Eu-doping largely decreases the superconducting volume and transition temperature TC. Eu atoms enter the clathrate lattice and their magnetic moments break paired electrons. The Curie-Weiss temperatures were observed at 3.9, 6.6, and 10.9 K, respectively, for samples with x¼0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Such ferromagnetic interaction of Eu can destroy superconductivity.

        researchName: 'Critical magnetic fields of superconducting aluminum-substituted Ba8Si42Al4 clathrate',
        description: 'In recent years, efforts have been made to explore the superconductivity of clathrates containing crystalline frameworks of group-IV elements. The superconducting silicon clathrate is unusual in that the structure is dominated by strong sp3 covalent bonds between silicon atoms, rather than the metallic bonding that is more typical of traditional superconductors. This paper reports on critical magnetic fields of superconducting Al-substituted silicon clathrates, which were investigated by transport, ac susceptibility, and dc magnetization measurements in magnetic fields up to 90 kOe. For the sample Ba8Si42Al4, the critical magnetic fields were measured to be HC1¼40.2 Oe and HC2¼66.4 kOe. The London penetration depth of 4360A ° and the coherence length 70A ° were obtained, whereas the estimated Ginzburg–Landau parameter of j¼62 revealed that Ba8Si42Al4 is a strong type-II superconductor.
